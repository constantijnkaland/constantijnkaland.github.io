  abstract = {Recent empirical studies have highlighted the large degree of analytic flexibility in data analysis that can lead to substantially different conclusions based on the same data set. Thus, researchers have expressed their concerns that these researcher degrees of freedom might facilitate bias and can lead to claims that do not stand the test of time. Even greater flexibility is to be expected in fields in which the primary data lend themselves to a variety of possible operationalizations. The multidimensional, temporally extended nature of speech constitutes an ideal testing ground for assessing the variability in analytic approaches, which derives not only from aspects of statistical modeling but also from decisions regarding the quantification of the measured behavior. In this study, we gave the same speech-production data set to 46 teams of researchers and asked them to answer the same research question, resulting in substantial variability in reported effect sizes and their interpretation. Using Bayesian meta-analytic tools, we further found little to no evidence that the observed variability can be explained by analysts' prior beliefs, expertise, or the perceived quality of their analyses. In light of this idiosyncratic variability, we recommend that researchers more transparently share details of their analysis, strengthen the link between theoretical construct and quantitative system, and calibrate their (un)certainty in their conclusions.},

  abstract = {This study analyzed unscripted, conversational speech to investigate differences in question intonation in Korean varieties spoken in Chungcheong (CC) and Gyeongsang (GS). It is traditionally assumed that, apart from differences in word-level prosody, these two varieties differ in their intonational marking of questions, the CC variety typically using a final fo rise, and the GS variety using a final fo fall. Hierarchical clustering of fo contours and random forest analysis were used to inspect patterns emerging from the data. Further manual examination was conducted for the individual fo patterns. An investigation of the effects of variety and question type (alternative, polar, and wh-questions) did not strongly support the traditional account of the dialectal difference. Nonetheless, evidence for the interaction between variety and question type predictors was shown in the distribution of fo contours, with the GS variety showing greater variation than the CC variety. The approach taken here constitutes an effective analytical pipeline for exploring the distribution of fo contours in speech data with a high degree of sociolinguistic variation that is generally absent in scripted speech data. This study further shows that combining data-driven and linguistically informed analyses is useful for reconciling phonetic and linguistic approaches to analyzing intonation.}

  abstract = {This paper reports an automatic data-driven analysis for describing prototypical intonation patterns, particularly suitable for initial stages of prosodic research and language description. The approach has several advantages over traditional ways to investigate intonation, such as the applicability to spontaneous speech, language- and domain-independency, and the potential of revealing meaningful functions of intonation. These features make the approach particularly useful for language documentation, where the description of prosody is often lacking. The core of this approach is a cluster analysis on a time-series of f0 measurements and consists of two scripts (Praat and R, available from ). Graphical user interfaces can be used to perform the analyses on collected data ranging from spontaneous to highly controlled speech. There is limited need for manual annotation prior to analysis and speaker variability can be accounted for. After cluster analysis, Praat textgrids can be generated with the cluster number annotated for each individual contour. Although further confirmatory analysis is still required, the outcomes provide useful and unbiased directions for any investigation of prototypical f0 contours based on their acoustic form.},

Two functions of Papuan Malay phrase prosody are analysed here, namely the marking of phrase boundaries (demarcating) and the marking of important elements within the phrase (highlighting). The limited work on Papuan Malay suggests that its prosody mainly serves a demarcating function. This hypothesis is tested by means of an acoustic analysis of F0 in phrase-final syllables. Results confirm previous work on demarcation but provide new insights into the role of highlighting in this language, suggesting a relevant difference as to syllable position: While final syllables mark boundaries, F0 movements on prefinal syllables seem to serve a highlighting function.},

This is done by a novel combination of exploratory and confirmatory classification techniques. In particular, this study investigates the linguistic factors that potentially drive f0 contour variation in phrase-final words produced in a naturalistic interactive dialogue task. To this end, a cluster analysis, manual labelling and random forest analysis are carried out to reveal the main sources of contour variation. These are: taking conversational interaction into account; turn transition, topic continuation, information structure (givenness and contrast), and context-independent properties of words such as word class, syllable structure, voicing and intrinsic f0. Results indicate that contour variation in Papuan Malay, in particular f0 direction and target level, is best explained by turn transitions between speakers, corroborating similar findings for related languages. The applied methods provide opportunities to further lower the threshold of incorporating intonation and prosody in the early stages of language documentation.},

  abstract = {Grouping helps listeners to break down the speech signal into smaller units. Specific acoustic cues, in particular duration and intensity, have been reported to determine grouping of disyllabic units across languages [Iambic--Trochaic Law (ITL)]. The ITL states that iambic grouping is obtained from syllabic sequences alternating in duration, whereas trochaic grouping is obtained from those alternating in intensity. Speakers of different languages vary in the extent to which they use the ITL. It has been proposed that this linguistic modulation of the ITL relates to cross-linguistic differences in prosody. The present study further investigates the predictions of the ITL in two under-researched languages, Papuan Malay and Akan, for which there is controversy on the existence of word stress. They are compared to German, a well-researched language with variable word stress. A perceptual grouping task used in previous work is replicated with listeners from each language. The results show considerable cross-linguistic differences and shed light on acoustic perceptual properties in Papuan Malay and Akan. The outcomes reconfirm cross-linguistic variability and modulation of the applicability of the ITL across languages.}

  abstract = {Recently, cluster analysis on f0 contours has become a popular method in phonetic research. Cluster analysis provides an automated way of categorising f0 contours, which gives new insights into (phonological) categories of intonation that vary across languages. As cluster analysis can be performed in many different ways, it is important to understand the extent to which these analyses can capture human perception of f0. This study focuses on the way in which f0 contours and differences among them are represented numerically, i.e., a crucial methodological choice preceding cluster analysis. These representations are then compared to the way in which f0 contour differences are perceived by human listeners from two different languages. To this end, four time-series contour representations (equivalent rectangular bandwidth, standardisation, octave-median rescaling, first derivative) and three distance measures [Euclidean distance (L2 norm), Pearson correlation, and dynamic time warping) were tested. The perceived differences were obtained from listeners of German and Papuan Malay, two typologically different languages. Results show that computed contour differences reflect human perception moderately, with dynamic time warping applied to the first derivative of the contour performing best, and showing minimal differences between the languages.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The existence of word stress in Indonesian languages has been controversial. Recent acoustic analyses of Papuan Malay suggest that this language has word stress, counter to other studies and unlike closely related languages. The current study further investigates Papuan Malay by means of lexical (non-acoustic) analyses of two different aspects of word stress. In particular, this paper reports two distribution analyses of a word corpus, 1) investigating the extent to which stress patterns may help word recognition and 2) exploring the phonological factors that predict the distribution of stress patterns. The facilitating role of stress patterns in word recognition was investigated in a lexical analysis of word embeddings. The results show that Papuan Malay word stress (potentially) helps to disambiguate words. As for stress predictors, a random forest analysis investigated the effect of multiple morpho-phonological factors on stress placement. It was found that the mid vowels /{$\varepsilon$}/ and /ɔ/ play a central role in stress placement, refining the conclusions of previous work that mainly focused on /{$\varepsilon$}/. The current study confirms that non-acoustic research on stress can complement acoustic research in important ways. Crucially, the combined findings on stress in Papuan Malay so far give rise to an integrated perspective to word stress, in which phonetic, phonological and cognitive factors are considered.},

The outcomes have contributed to the conclusion that these languages do not have word stress. The current study revisits this conclusion and investigates to what extent speakers of Papuan Malay, a language of Eastern Indonesia, use suprasegmental stress cues to recognize words. Acoustically, this language exhibits predictable word level prominence patterns, which could facilitate word recognition. However, the literature lacks a crucial perceptual verification and related languages in the Trade Malay family have been analysed as stressless. This could be indicative of either regional variation or different criteria to diagnose word stress. To investigate this issue, the current study reviews the literature on which criteria were decisive to diagnose (the absence of) word stress in Indonesian and Trade Malay. An acoustic analysis and a gating task investigate the usefulness of Papuan Malay stress cues for word recognition. Results show that Papuan Malay listeners are indeed able to use suprasegmental stress cues to identify words. The outcomes are discussed in a typological perspective to shed light on how production and perception studies contribute to stress diagnosis cross-linguistically.},

  abstract = {It has frequently been shown that speakers prosodically reduce repeated words in discourse. This phenomenon has been claimed to facilitate speech recognition and to be language universal. In particular, the relationship between the information value of a word in a discourse context and its prosodic prominence have been shown to correlate. However, a literature review provided in this paper reveals that most evidence comes from English, where prosodic marking of information status often coincides with repetition reduction. The current study investigates to what extent repetition reduction occurs in Papuan Malay, spoken in the western part of the island of New Guinea (Indonesia). The work on Papuan Malay prosody available to date suggests fundamental differences compared to English and other Germanic languages. An acoustic analysis is carried out on repeated words in short stories produced by native Papuan Malay speakers. The results show that upon repetition, words were shortened and produced with higher F0. In a subsequent word identification task, it was found that first and second mentions were equally intelligible. Conclusions partially confirm previous work and challenge theories on how the prosody and information value of a word are related.},

Although boundary marking has been uncontroversially shown as the major prosodic function in these languages, studies on the use of pitch accents to highlight important words in a phrase remain inconclusive. In addition, most knowledge of pitch accents is based on well-researched languages such as the ones from the Western-Germanic language family. This paper reports two word identification experiments comparing Papuan Malay with the pitch accent language American English, in order to investigate the~extent to which the demarcating and highlighting function of prosody can be disentangled. To this end, target words were presented to native listeners of both languages and differed with respect to their position in the phrase (medial or final) and the shape of their f0 movement (original or manipulated). Reaction times for the target word identifications revealed overall faster responses for original and final words compared to manipulated and medial ones. The results add to previous findings on the facilitating effect of pitch accents and further improve our prosodic knowledge of underresearched languages.},

These aspects, in order of presentation, include acoustic realisation, auditory perception, lexical analyses and word disambiguation. The introduction provides the theoretical background against which the studies are undertaken. All studies are empirical in nature; they either report acoustic analyses, production or perception experiments, or corpus-based analyses. Taken together, the results of all studies pose a challenge to maintaining a stressless analysis of Papuan Malay. At the same time, the type of word stress that emerges from the reported results is unlike its common theoretical conception and therefore requires more work to be integrated in prosodic theory. Given the controversy on word stress in Indonesian languages, the results are always discussed and carefully interpreted in a cross-linguistic context. In this way, the current thesis extends and deepens our knowledge and understanding of word stress in prosodic theory.},

The first restrict the class to which the antecedent in the main clause refers, whereas the latter denote an additional property of the antecedent. How this difference is reflected in prosody is topic of investigation. For both languages a perception experiment was carried out to test the effect of intonational and temporal cues on the interpretation of restrictive and appositive relative clauses. Results indicate that Dutch and not German listeners can distinguish both clauses on the basis of those cues.},

Two functions of Papuan Malay phrase prosody are analysed here, namely the marking of phrase boundaries (demarcating) and the marking of important elements within the phrase (highlighting). The limited work on Papuan Malay suggests that its prosody mainly serves a demarcating function. This hypothesis is tested by means of an acoustic analysis of F0 in phrase-final syllables. Results confirm previous work on demarcation but provide new insights into the role of highlighting in this language, suggesting a relevant difference as to syllable position: While final syllables mark boundaries, F0 movements on prefinal syllables seem to serve a highlighting function.},

# This script goes through sound and TextGrid files in a directory,
# opens each pair of Sound and TextGrid, extracts stylized F0 contours from 
# intervals of specified length, takes a specified number of F0 measures equally 
# distributed over the contour, and saves results to a comma-separated csv-file.
# Octave jumps can be handled, in which case mean F0 per interval is measured 
# before and after handling. The difference between both means (m1/m2) is then
# given in an additional column "jumpkilleffect". Stylization resolution (ST)
# can be specified by user.
#
# The generated output serves time-series analyses of F0, such as GAMMs or cluster analysis.
#
# The core structure of this script is based on "collect_pitch_data_from_files.praat"
# by Mietta Lennes (https://lennes.github.io/spect/).
